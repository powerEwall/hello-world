Greetings from a bashful beginner!

Getting started with learning Power Platform programs (initially Power Apps and Power Automate).  Using Microsoft Learn as well as Sifting through information and videos that are free-sourced. Was referenced to GitHub after watching Laura Rogers PowerHour on the Crisis Communication App that was shared and will be working throught loading that this month.

Since I'm new to GitHub, am trying to understand how it works.
